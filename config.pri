###
### In most cases, defaults and auto-detection should provide an easy way of
### building SciDAVis without changing anything in this file (in contrast to
### prior versions).
###
### Windows users are expected to place all dependencies in the 3rdparty folder
### with default directory names (i.e., with version numbers stripped). In case
### you already have copies of the libraries installed somewhere, you need to
### change the paths below in order to use them.
###
### On Linux and MacOS X, the default configuration assumes Qwt and QwtPlot3D
### sources to be unpacked to the 3rdparty folders, with version numbers
### stripped from the directory names (as on Windows). If you're sure that a
### system-wide installation of Qwt and QwtPlot3D (e.g. from your distribution's
### package manager) is compiled against Qt4 (not Qt3), you can use it by
### executing "qmake PRESET=linux_package" instead of just "qmake" during the
### build process. Note that this also disables some features which are
### commonly not needed or even bothersome when integrating SciDAVis in a
### package manager (user-selectable paths to manual/plugins, checking for new
### versions on startup).
